# Wordle

This project is a replica of the popular game Wordle. It works exactly the same as Wordle on the New York Times website with a few additional components.
Here are the key features:
+ Object oriented design
+ Live wordbank of 2000 words
+ Scoreboard with winrate
+ Custom words
+ New game button
+ Memory clear button (hidden by default)

My design is based around two key classes: the Word and the WordList. Word contains the method used to validate words and WordList contains all methods that deal with accessing the file and manipulating the word array. This object oriented design produces an organized and stable product with a smooth flow of data.
